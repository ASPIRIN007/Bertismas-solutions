# Exercise 1.1*

Suppose \(f:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}\) is both concave and convex. Prove \(f\) is affine.

## Solution

Since \(f\) is convex and concave, for any \(x,y\) and \(0\le \lambda \le 1\),
\[
f(\lambda x + (1-\lambda)y)=\lambda f(x)+(1-\lambda)f(y).
\]

Define \(g(x)=f(x)-f(0)\). Then \(g(0)=0\) and the equality implies linearity (additivity + homogeneity),
so \(g(x)=a^T x\) and \(f(x)=f(0)+a^T x\), i.e. affine.
